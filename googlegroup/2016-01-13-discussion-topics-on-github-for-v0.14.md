# Discussion topics on Github for v0.14

Hey there,

I reorganized the issues for patternplate-server a bit. Now there are

* Milestones
* More shiny labels.

The next milestone is 0.14 and some pretty cool new features are bound to land with it - but I need you to throw in your two cents!

It would be awesome if you took part in the discussion on the following issue (basically everything that carries the "discussion" label)

* Introduce React automounting #45
* Enable requires between source files of a single pattern
* Make build tool versions configurable by user

Thanks a lot!

Cheers,
Mario
