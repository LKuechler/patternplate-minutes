# patternplate: state of the union and vision

Hey there,

I'd like to bootstrap our discussion about the vision for patternplate with my two cents. Please drop your thoughts here, too!

## State of the union
- s2-intern usage by a broad range of projects
- current version of the project is rather battle tested
- lacking documentation
- no/next-to-none mindshare outside of s2

## Vision
Mission statement
patternplate strives to provide the best platform for development, presentation and maintenance of Living Style Guides for the net.

## Principles
- Open and transparent by default
  Development and discussion on the platform are inclusive and open to everyone. Patternplate style guides make details of the project understandable and transparent to all stakeholders.

- The source is the styleguide
  Patternplate style guides are exactly what they document. This enable full life cycle support of projects.

- First-class components
  Patternplate style guides are made up from reusable components. This holds true for a multitude of integration environments.#

- Full lifecycle
  Patternplate style guides help with both initial development and longterm maintenance of style guides

- Plug and play
  Getting up and running with a basic patternplate setup is a matter of minutes


Cheers,
Mario
